        <h3>World Class Library</h3>
        <p>A web development library is a collection of pre-written code, functions, and tools that streamline and simplify the process of creating websites and web applications. These libraries often include commonly used features, such as user interface components, data handling, and interaction with web technologies, allowing developers to save time and effort by reusing these building blocks rather than starting from scratch. Popular web development libraries include jQuery for client-side scripting, React for building user interfaces, and Express for server-side web application development.</p>
